Kiana Setoodehnia for her mutual dissatisfaction for existing tools and valuable
experience outside of the nuclear physics bubble.

* Installation Instructions

It is recommended you use at least Python 3.9, but compatibility has been tested with Python 3.8. If you computer
does not have access to AVX, it will be necessary to install ~polars_lts_cpu~ separately from the ~sauce~ installation. 
When you are ready to install ~sauce~, clone this repository, and use pip to install.

#+begin_src bash
  git clone https://github.com/camarsha/sauce.git
  cd sauce
  python -m pip install .
#+end_src 


** Suggested Additions
 It is highly recommend that =ipython= or another full featured python REPL
 be installed when using =sauce=. Drawing 2D gates with =sauce.gates.CreateGate2D=
 is not supported in =jupyter= notebooks.

 If you are using =emacs=, I have a [[https://github.com/camarsha/python-vterm][small repository]] to use =vterm= for an =ipython=
 REPL (that is essentially a find a replace copy of the [[https://github.com/shg/julia-vterm.el][one for Julia]]) that works well enough for me.
