experience outside of the nuclear physics bubble.

* Installation Instructions

Clone this repository, and use pip to install.

#+begin_src python
pip install .
#+end_src 

** Suggested Additions
 It is highly recommend that =ipython= or another full featured python REPL
 be installed when using =sauce=. Drawing 2D gates with =sauce.gates.CreateGate2D=
 is not supported in =jupyter= notebooks.

 If you are using =emacs=, I have a [[https://github.com/camarsha/python-vterm][small repository]] to use =vterm= for an =ipython=
 REPL (that is essentially a find a replace copy of the [[https://github.com/shg/julia-vterm.el][one for Julia]]) that works well enough for me.
